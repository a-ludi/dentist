/**
    This package contains methods to handle the proprietary binary data
    containers used to store information between stages of the algorithm.
    Currently, there are two containers:

    $(UL
        $(LI `dentist.common.binio.pileupdb` for pile ups,
            i.e. candidate sets of reads for gap closing)
        $(LI `dentist.common.binio.insertiondb` for insertions,
            i.e. consensus sequence and splicing information generated
            from pile ups)
    )
